# Rain-check-SMS-Alert

This app checks the next 12 hours of weather forecasts by retrieving the data from Open Weather Map's API and then sends you a text message to bring an umbrella if it will rain. 

This app should theoretically be launched in the cloud and with a Twillio API account set up for anybody who downloads it.
